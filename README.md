# IMS Project

This IMS project covers Java, Maven, MYSQL, JUNIT testing all working together in one project. You can keep track of Customer data and create customers to be added to the customer table in the database, Once the customer is created you are able to update the customer to change the values or delete the customer completely. This project also gives you the capability to create and store Item objects, once an item is created you can update and change the values of an item or delete the item completely. The customer is tied to the orders of the project giving the customer an option to create an order and add items to the order. Items can be stored in the order using the Order/Items table which connects Items to Orders to handle the relationship between the two.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
These tests test individual units or components to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected.
You can run these tests by going into any testing class and right click and go down to coverage as-junit 1. 
You can then open the class that it is testing to see what the tests are doing and the lines will turn green if the test has passed and red if the test did not pass.

```

### Integration Tests 
Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them
An Integration test, tests the interface between two softwares 
```
In the DAO tests we are testing how our data is interacting between our project and MYSQL.
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why
these tests test every line of code in the project individually
```
In the some of the tests in this project you can see that some of the tests done test every line of code in the method it is testing.
```
